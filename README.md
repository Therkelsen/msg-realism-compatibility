If you experience any issues, feel free to open an issue. If fixing it yourself is more your thing, there's a guide on how to contribute below.

Shoutout to [OptimusChad](https://hub.sp-tarkov.com/user/55363-optimuschad/) who made [the patch](https://hub.sp-tarkov.com/files/file/2017-realism-compatibility-for-massivesoft-weapons/#versions) for the original mods by [Massivesoft](https://hub.sp-tarkov.com/files/user-file-list/18902-massivesoft/), rather than [Pettan](https://hub.sp-tarkov.com/user/29815-pettan/)'s [port](https://hub.sp-tarkov.com/files/file/1670-massivesoft-s-guns/#overview). I've used their values for inspiration, in some places more than others.
